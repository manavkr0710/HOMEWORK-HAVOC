## ABOUT HOMEWORK HAVOC
This is a game that I decided to create during my winter break. Prior to going into the break, I had a partial hate for homework due to all the stress that built up after first semester, and I wanted to have some fun creating a game to relieve my stress. I ended up creating Homework Havoc, a game where I took inspiration from the famous Chrome Dino game. However, I wanted to add my own taste and instead of jumping over obstacles, the character in my game is forced to dogde pages of paper that are flying at the character.

## Creating the game
I used Python as that was the language I recently learned after first semester of University. Creating the frontend with Python was not easy, compared to working on the backend. 

Thank you for viewing my game! Feel free to download the zip folder and try it out! 

## NOTE
I would like to also mention that this is my first project, and as I slowly progress through my computer science journey, I will start making more project that are different than this. 

THANK YOU FOR VIEWING HOMEWORK HAVOC!
